const questions: [string, string][] = [
  [
    "Is Codync free?",
    "Yes. Codync costs $0 with every feature included, and it's MIT licensed. You pay only your agent's provider, through the plan or key you already have.",
  ],
  [
    "Can I use my Claude or ChatGPT plan?",
    "Yes. Codync runs the agents already signed in on your computer: Claude Code with your Claude plan, Codex with your ChatGPT plan, and so on. It never calls a provider's API with your login.",
  ],
  [
    "Which agents can it run?",
    "Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, Copilot, OpenCode and about 40 more through the Agent Client Protocol registry. Each bot picks its own.",
  ],
  [
    "How do I start?",
    "Install Codync on the computer your agents run on and create a bot. Then pair your iPhone by scanning the code from the Mac menu bar, the Linux app or codync-host pair.",
  ],
  [
    "Where does my data go?",
    "Bots, chats and memory stay on your computer. Your phone reaches it directly on the same network, or through an end-to-end encrypted relay anywhere else, which can't read your messages. Your agent's provider receives the prompts the agent sends.",
  ],
  [
    "Do I need an account?",
    "No. Pair your phone by scanning a code. Signing in with Apple or Google is optional: it lists every computer on your account on your phone, and each computer still approves each device itself.",
  ],
  [
    "Which computers can run it?",
    "A Mac, or a Linux desktop or headless server. The iPhone app and the terminal UI over SSH talk to the same host.",
  ],
  [
    "Is it safe to let bots work on my computer?",
    "Bots act with your permissions. When an agent asks to edit files or run a command, the request comes to your phone to allow once, always allow or deny. Give bots work you trust, and keep backups.",
