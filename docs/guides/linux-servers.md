# Running the host on a Linux server or cloud VM

`codync-host` runs on any 64-bit Linux machine: a desktop, a home server, or a headless cloud VM (AWS, GCP, Azure, Hetzner, DigitalOcean…). It needs no display. Bots run on that machine and you message them from the iPhone, the desktop app or `codync-host tui`.

## Requirements

| Need | Why |
| --- | --- |
| x86_64 or arm64 Linux | Release builds exist for both architectures |
| `ca-certificates` | HTTPS to the ACP registry, push relay and cloud. Every normal VM image has it; bare container images (`debian`, `ubuntu`) need `apt-get install ca-certificates`. Without it every command exits with `TLS setup failed: install the ca-certificates package` |
| systemd | Only for `codync-host install` (background service). Without systemd, run `codync-host serve` under your own supervisor |
| Node.js | Claude Code, Codex and Pi run through ACP adapters fetched with `npx` |
| The agents you want, signed in | The host drives the CLIs installed on this machine with their own credentials. Sign in over SSH (`claude`, `codex login`…) as the same user that runs the host |

Distro and C library don't matter. From the first release built by the updated workflow, Linux release binaries are static musl builds with no glibc dependency. Earlier releases (≤ 2.1.0) were built against glibc 2.39 and only start on Ubuntu 24.04 or newer. On older distros they fail with `GLIBC_2.39 not found`; build from source or use a newer release there.

## Install

Run as the user who owns the agents (not root, unless the agents are root's):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leepokai/Codync/main/packaging/install.sh | sh -s -- --host-only
# or: brew install leepokai/codync/codync-host
codync-host install                    # systemd --user service, restarts on crash
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"    # keep it running after you log out of SSH
codync-host status
```

The script puts `codync-host` in `~/.local/bin` (`/usr/local/bin` as root; override with `CODYNC_BIN_DIR`), checks its SHA-256, and restarts the service on upgrade. `install` saves the current `PATH` into the service, so install Node and the agents first. If you add an agent later and the host doesn't find it, run `codync-host install` again. `install` needs a real login session (SSH login, not `sudo su user`), otherwise `systemctl --user` can't reach the user's service manager.

Other commands work the same as on a desktop: `codync-host pair`, `codync-host tui`, `codync-host uninstall` (keeps data in `~/.codync`). Logs go to the journal: `journalctl --user -u codync-host -f`.

## Reaching it from the phone

The phone connects over the encrypted device channel. The pairing link lists only **Tailscale** and **private (LAN/VPC)** addresses; the host never advertises a public IP.

- **Tailscale (recommended for VMs):** install Tailscale on the VM and on the phone, then `codync-host pair`. The Tailscale name comes first in the link. You don't need to open port 19222 in the cloud firewall.
- **Cloudflare cloud:** `codync-host cloud --url https://…` if you run your own Codync cloud. The production cloud isn't live yet (see [environments](environments-and-deployment.md)).
- **Desktop app over SSH:** the desktop app (macOS or Linux) can attach an SSH computer and tunnel to its loopback API ([Accounts and SSH](accounts-and-ssh.md)). From any terminal: `ssh -L 19222:127.0.0.1:19222 vm`, then `codync-host tui` locally.

The host listens on `0.0.0.0:19222`. The local API (`/api/*`, `/events`, terminals; bearer token) answers **loopback callers only**, so a public address never exposes it. From outside, only `/health` (host id, computer id, version) and the end-to-end encrypted device channel answer, and the channel only serves devices holding this host's pairing keys. Keep 19222 closed in the cloud firewall anyway unless you deliberately pair over a VPN or private network.

## Limitations on a headless server

- **Remote screen and the `computer` tool don't work.** They need a desktop session (portals + GStreamer, `apps/screen-linux/`). The feature is off by default, so nothing else is affected.
- **No desktop app.** The Linux desktop app (`codync`, AppImage/deb/tar.gz) needs a graphical session; it uses the installed `codync-host`. On a server, use the phone, the desktop app on another computer over SSH, or `codync-host tui`.
- **Keep-awake is a no-op.** The host tries `systemd-inhibit` while a bot works; VMs don't sleep, and failure only logs a warning.
- **One computer per account.** A VM counts as the account's computer; multiple computers are future work.
- **Usage limits** come from the local Claude and Codex installs, same as on a desktop.

## Verification — 2026-09-26

Tested in Docker on arm64 (the x86_64 build is the same code and the same CI job):

- Static musl build of `host/` 2.2.0 started on Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12, Amazon Linux 2023, Rocky Linux 9 and Alpine 3. `serve`, `status`, `pair --json`, `info` and `cloud` worked with no display.
- On a systemd container (Ubuntu 22.04, lingering user): `install` created and started the service, `pair` worked, a killed host was restarted by systemd with a new PID, and `uninstall` removed it and kept the data.
- The v2.1.0 glibc release failed on Ubuntu 22.04 and Debian 12 (`GLIBC_2.39 not found`). The workflow now builds musl for that reason.
- Host tests passed on Linux: 101 + 9 + 1.

Not covered: a real cloud provider VM, pairing a physical iPhone over Tailscale to a VM, and bot turns with signed-in agents on the VM (these need real credentials). Those use the same code paths as a Linux desktop.
