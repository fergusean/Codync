# Routines

Routines belong to an agent bot and are usually created by talking to it ("I want
a routine that…"). Every agent receives the built-in `routines` MCP server. The desktop
conversation details panel and the iPhone's **More → Routines** show a compact list
(name, schedule, on/off switch). The header's chat button puts "I want a routine
that " in the composer; **+** opens the form for doing it by hand. A row opens
the same form filled in, with delete and test run beside Save; the row's switch
pauses and resumes. Run results appear in the chat. The form is name, instruction, a **When to run** type (Schedule or Webhook, the two
Claude Code routines also offer besides GitHub events) and a run timeout; cron is
written directly as five fields plus an IANA time zone, and the host checks it and
shows the summary and next run. One-off times, intervals, events and multiple
triggers are left to the bot: editing such a routine shows its current triggers as
the selected type and keeps them until Schedule or Webhook replaces them. The TUI (`n` form with a typed When, `c` asks the bot) match.
A saved webhook routine's form shows its public URL and key (copy, reveal, replace
with confirmation; TUI `w` copies a curl command and `W` replaces the
key). Creation/update notices open the routine.

## Apple setup interface

The editor keeps task fields first, then a When to run type menu and its settings.
Inputs use the shared palette with a visible filled surface. New recurring schedules
default to a typed cron expression and an explicit IANA time zone; the host
describes it and shows the next run. Run timeout is under an animated Run settings
expansion. A fixed footer keeps Create routine / Save changes and inline errors
visible while the form scrolls.
The layout uses the same light/dark tokens, type family and custom controls as the
rest of Codync, with Reduce Motion support.

## Conversational setup and tools

Every agent receives the `routines` MCP server automatically; no marketplace
installation is needed. Its tools are `list_routines`, `save_routine`,
`set_routine_enabled`, `delete_routine`, `run_routine` and `routine_webhook`.
The same setup guidance is included in newly rendered agent context and MCP
initialization instructions.

For chat setup, the bot should resolve the task, trigger and timezone from the
conversation, asking only about missing or ambiguous details. It should check the
task's required tools, sign-ins and files, list existing routines to avoid
accidental duplication, then save and report the returned configuration and next
occurrence. A saved webhook whose external sender is not connected must be
reported as awaiting connection. Testing runs the actual instruction, so creating
a schedule alone should not trigger an unsolicited test execution.

A deterministic ACP fixture exercises the actual advertised MCP subprocess:
initialize, discover all six tools, reject an invalid schedule, create, read,
edit, pause/resume, fetch webhook credentials, delete, and execute a test run.
This verifies tool wiring and persisted behavior; it does not guarantee how every
provider model will interpret an ambiguous natural-language request.

## Triggers

A routine has an OR list of triggers:

- `interval`: `seconds` (1 second through 365 days).
- `once`: `at` (Unix milliseconds, in the future when created).
- `cron`: a five-field `expression` and IANA `timeZone`, including DST.
- `webhook`: every authenticated JSON delivery runs the routine.
- `event`: `source`, `event` (`*` matches all), and optional exact-match `filters`.
  `messageContains` matches a substring of `text`. Source names are `slack`,
  `github`, `origin`, `microsoftTeams`, `linear`, `sentry`, `pagerduty`, and `email`.

For example, Sunday at 14:20 in Taipei is `20 14 * * 0` with `Asia/Taipei`.
The host computes and displays the next occurrence. Calendar parsing uses
[Croner](https://docs.rs/croner/3.0.1/croner/), with chrono-tz for named zones.

## Execution

The host checks deadlines every second, even with no client connected. Definitions,
next deadlines and run records are saved in SQLite (`routines.v1`). Due triggers
are coalesced into one run per routine; only one routine per bot is dispatched at a
time. Bot actors serialize routine work with ordinary conversation work.

Each run gets its own conversation thread and agent session. Final results appear
in the main conversation and use normal encrypted push delivery. Returning `(pass)`
or no text completes silently. A test run can run a paused routine. Pausing or
deleting cancels pending runs; work already running can finish. Deleting a bot
cancels its pending work. Missed intervals coalesce rather than replaying a backlog.

Pending runs survive a restart. The actor claims a run only when it reaches the
front of its queue, using the latest saved instruction. Runs interrupted during
execution become `recovering` and load their existing agent session. If the
provider cannot load it, they become `interrupted` instead of replaying the task
in a new session. Session recovery cannot guarantee exactly-once external side
effects; inspect the transcript before retrying an interrupted action.

Each run has a timeout (default one hour, configurable from 1 to 86400 seconds).
A hung agent is terminated so subsequent work can proceed. Completed results are
persisted before publication, with stable transcript IDs to avoid duplicate
results after restart. Failed publication retries without rerunning the agent.
The latest 1000 terminal runs are retained globally, plus active/unpublished runs;
the panel returns the latest 200 runs per bot. Deduplication lasts while the
corresponding run record is retained.

Intervals retain their original cadence; missed deadlines coalesce into one
pending wake, including when a prior run is still active. Enabled time schedules
keep the computer from idle sleep. Explicit sleep, closing the lid and powering
off still suspend local execution. The host uses an exclusive data-directory lock
to prevent two daemons from firing the same schedules. Shutdown stops scheduling
before stopping actors.

## Webhook delivery

Every webhook routine has a key and two addresses (`routineWebhook`): the public
`{cloud}/v1/hooks/{computerId}/{routineId}` through the Codync cloud (null while the
cloud is off) and the local `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/hooks/routines/<id>`. Both run
the same checks (`host/src/routines/hooks.rs`); the protocol is
[spec §7.8](../reference/remote-relay.md).

- **Authentication**: `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, or `X-Hub-Signature-256` (an
  HMAC-SHA256 of the body with the key). For GitHub: payload URL = the public URL,
  content type `application/json`, secret = the key. `routineWebhook` with
  `rotate: true` replaces the key; the old one stops working at once, including in
  the cloud.
- **Events**: a JSON object is the event as-is; a GitHub delivery becomes
  `{source:"github", event:"<event>.<action>", repo, sender, text, url, payload}`
  (GitHub `ping` succeeds without running); other bodies become `{text}`. Event
  triggers filter on these fields, for example:

```json
{"source":"github","event":"pull_request.opened","repo":"owner/repo","text":"A PR opened"}
```

- **Delivery**: `X-Delivery-Id`, `X-GitHub-Delivery` or `Idempotency-Key`
  deduplicates retries against retained run records. Bodies are limited to 64 KB.
  A paused routine refuses (`409`); a non-matching event is accepted and ignored.
  While the routine is running, the local endpoint answers `409` and the cloud
  queue retries later (30 s doubling to 15 min).
- **Offline**: the cloud keeps public deliveries for up to 72 hours and hands them
  over one at a time once the host is back; the host acknowledges each.
- **Trust**: deliveries are not end-to-end encrypted. The cloud terminates HTTPS,
  sees the content and stores the key to check signatures. The host checks the key
  again before anything runs.

Codync does not create provider subscriptions: the user (or the bot, with the user)
pastes the URL and key into the sending service. Do not describe an event routine as
connected before a real delivery has arrived.

## API

All normal methods use the existing authenticated host API / authorized E2E channel:

| Method | Body |
|---|---|
| `routines` | `botId` |
| `routineSchedule` | `triggers` + preferred `timeZone` to load, or `draft` to preview; returns hydrated form, validated triggers, summary, warning, next run |
| `saveRoutine` | `botId`, optional `id`, `name`, `instruction`, `schedule` form or `triggers`, optional `enabled`, `timeoutSeconds` |
| `setRoutineEnabled` | `botId`, `id`, `enabled` |
| `deleteRoutine` | `botId`, `id` |
| `runRoutine` | `botId`, `id` |
| `routineWebhook` | `botId`, `id`, optional `rotate`; returns `url` (public or null), `localUrl`, `key`, `connected` |

The local-only `routineCall` backs the MCP tools. Each MCP instance is scoped to
its bot. Phone and desktop panels refresh while visible; definitions do not currently
participate in offline client caches. Run transcript entries use normal rev/SSE.

## Reference and parity

Observed on the installed Grok Bot on 2026-09-26: a routine list in conversation
details, instruction and trigger details, pause/resume, delete, and chat-based
editing. Creation produces a linked transcript card. The shipped renderer also
contains test-run and webhook credential controls, interval/one-shot/cron schedule
formatting and multiple provider trigger types.

The local reconstruction at
`/Users/libokai/mycode/nimplex/sandbox/grok-bot-architecture-2026-09-15` contains a
partial automation fire consumer with event matching, durable wake delivery and
completion reporting. Most automation modules it imports are absent. Its renderer
and private cloud are not source-complete references.

Remaining differences from the reference: provider subscription provisioning,
cloud execution while the host is offline (deliveries wait in the cloud instead), and
inactivity auto-pause. The Apple UI
uses Codync's shared native controls. This is not a verified complete one-to-one
reconstruction of every Grok Bot routine behavior.

## Validation

`host/tests/routines_e2e.rs` starts isolated hosts and deterministic ACP agents,
checks real scheduled execution, webhook credentials, delivery deduplication,
pause/delete/edit while queued, crash recovery in the same session, unsupported
session recovery, hung-agent timeout, recurring work after failure, single-host
ownership, silent completion, and the advertised routine MCP server (including key
rotation). Unit tests cover timezone calculation, invalid schedules, event filters,
persistence, pause/resume, bot ownership, bearer/HMAC checks, GitHub event mapping and
the relay's hook registration, acks and retries. `cloud/test/hooks.test.ts` covers the
edge checks, queue limits, deduplication, ordering, retry and expiry; the cloud e2e
(`npm run e2e`, step 5b) delivers through a real Worker and host, including a signed
GitHub delivery queued while the host was down. Swift tests cover the wire model and
transcript links.

## Public webhook ingress without a fixed IP

Research checked on 2026-09-26: [OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai/cli/webhooks)
uses Tailscale Funnel and the [Hermes webhook adapter](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/main/website/docs/user-guide/messaging/webhooks.md)
needs a reachable server URL. Codync instead reuses the host's outbound relay socket
(above): no fixed IP, open port or per-user tunnel, and deliveries survive the
computer being off. A user's own Cloudflare Tunnel to the local endpoint also works
but needs their own account, domain and `cloudflared`, and drops deliveries while the
computer is off.

## Usability comparison (2026-09-27)

The installed Grok Bot was inspected through Computer Use. Its sidebar emphasizes
the routine name and a human-readable schedule (for example, Every Sunday at
2:20 PM). Details expose Instruction, When to run, Pause, Edit and Delete. The
conversation contains a linked creation notice; an existing edit draft refers to
the routine by name. No reference routine was run, paused or deleted during this
comparison.

Codync retains that compact sidebar and the chat-based setup path, while providing
a direct editor where cron is typed as written (the earlier frequency/clock pickers
were removed as too heavy). Existing duration intervals keep their cadence until
explicitly replaced. Editing hydrates the original expression, timezone and interval
exactly; compound and provider-event triggers retain a lossless Keep existing
triggers fallback. Expired one-shot timestamps are preserved when editing other fields.

Saved definitions appear immediately. Paused schedules omit next-run deadlines.
List rows and details expose queued/running/recovery/failure states.
Edit with bot includes the routine ID in a draft without sending it.

## Cron scheduling contract

All newly configured recurring schedules in the editors use `cron` (sent as
`calendarStyle: custom` with the typed expression) and run through the host's
existing Croner scheduler. The host keeps preset compilation for its API. Cron generation, parsing, validation, timezone checks, descriptions and next-run
calculation all live in `host/src/routines/editor.rs` and `schedule.rs`. The Swift
draft is only a Codable form DTO. The editor debounces preview requests, discards
stale responses, shows host errors and disables Save until the current draft is
validated. Save sends the form to the host, which independently compiles and
validates it again. Both direct trigger API calls and Bot MCP calls use the same
host scheduler. Run timeout text is also parsed and validated by the host.
The built-in agent instructions also select cron for recurring clock schedules.

Existing elapsed-duration intervals remain readable/editable without silently
changing their execution times. An interval anchored to creation time cannot be
converted to a wall-clock cron without changing its cadence. One-time schedules
retain their absolute timestamp: five-field cron has no year or run-count guard.
Webhook/event triggers remain event-driven. These paths are intentionally not
misrepresented as cron. The host must still be running and awake.

Rust regression tests cover default cron creation, preset round trips, arbitrary
minute selection, timezone validation, custom expression preservation, existing
interval and expired one-shot preservation, and next occurrences across month
boundaries. An isolated HTTP integration test previews, saves and reloads the same
form and verifies direct saves reject invalid drafts. Swift tests cover wire DTO
decoding and millisecond date binding; there is no Swift cron implementation.
